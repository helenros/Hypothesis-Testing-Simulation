# Walk the Curve: Z-Test Hypothesis Testing Simulation

This interactive web app demonstrates hypothesis testing for a population mean using the Z-test. It is designed for kinesthetic and active learners to simulate roles in the hypothesis testing process.

## Features

- Role-based interface where users choose one of the following roles:
  - **Storyteller:** Sets the scenario for the test.
  - **Sample Collector:** Generates random sample data.
  - **Calculator:** Computes sample mean, standard error, and Z-value.
  - **Judge:** Sets significance level (Î±) and calculates critical Z-value.
  - **Decision Maker:** Visualizes the Z-distribution and announces the test decision.

- Generate sample data and perform Z-test calculations interactively.
- Visualize standard normal distribution with rejection regions and sample Z-score.
- Step by step educational approach reflecting classroom simulations.

## Installation
