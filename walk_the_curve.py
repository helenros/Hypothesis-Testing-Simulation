           Welcome to the Walk the Curve simulation! This simulation immerses you in hypothesis testing through Caf√© Brew‚Äôs 2-minute coffee service claim. Participants assume various roles‚Äîfrom defining hypotheses and gathering data to calculation and decision-making‚Äîusing Z-test concepts. By interacting with real sample data, users learn to evaluate statistical evidence, interpret Z-scores, and understand significance levels. This hands-on experience demonstrates how statistical methods support operational business decisions, making abstract concepts accessible through a practical, engaging scenario.

     Welcome to the Walk the Curve simulation! Caf√© Brew, a rapidly expanding coffee retailer, recently launched an ambitious campaign promising customers that coffee will be served in under 2 minutes. This operational strategy targets busy customers seeking quick service without compromising quality. Before the campaign is implemented nationwide, the management tasked operations analyst Riya Sharma to validate this claim using statistical evidence.

The Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ) assumes that the average coffee preparation time is exactly 2 minutes, as claimed by Caf√© Brew, implying no difference or change regardless of varying conditions.

The Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ) posits that the actual average preparation time differs from 2 minutes, reflecting potential deviations during busy hours.

Clearly stating these hypotheses is crucial because it establishes the question the data aims to answer and directs the subsequent analysis. Defining both hypotheses provides a clear criterion for decision-making: evidence will either support rejecting or failing to reject the null hypothesis. This process underpins objective statistical reasoning, guides interpretation of test results, and ensures that conclusions are logically and scientifically grounded."""},
